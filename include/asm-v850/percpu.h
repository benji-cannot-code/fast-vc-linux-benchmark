   dependency; basically, <linux/smp.h> uses BUG_ON, which calls BUG, but
   doesn't include the necessary headers to define it.  In the twisted
   festering mess of includes this must all be resolved somehow on other
   platforms, but I haven't the faintest idea how, and don't care; here will
   do, even though doesn't actually make any sense.  */
